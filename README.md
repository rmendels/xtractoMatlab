# xtractoMatlab
Matlab Version of xtractomatic package

`xtractoMatlab` contains <span style="color:blue">Matlab</span> functions developed to subset and extract satellite and other oceanographic related data from a remote server. The program can extract data for a moving point in time along a user-supplied set of longitude, latitude and time points; in a 3D bounding box; or within a polygon (through time).  The `xtractoMatlab` functions were originally developed for the marine biology tagging community, to match up environmental data available from satellites (sea-surface temperature, sea-surface chlorophyll, sea-surface height, sea-surface salinity, vector winds) to track data from various tagged animals or shiptracks (`xtracto`). The package has since been extended to include the routines that extract data a 3D bounding box (`xtracto_3D`) or within a polygon (`xtractogon`).  The `xtractoMatlab`  package accesses  data that are served through the <span style="color:blue">ERDDAP</span> (Environmental Research Division Data Access Program) server at the NOAA/SWFSC Environmental Research Division in Santa Cruz, California. The <span style="color:blue">ERDDAP</span> server can also be directly accessed at <http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap>. <span style="color:blue">ERDDAP</span> is a simple to use yet powerful web data service developed by Bob Simons.
